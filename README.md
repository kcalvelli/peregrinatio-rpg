## How to Use

1. **Begin with Character Sheets** – Each player chooses Knight, Navigator, Monastic, or Illuminator. Record starting Virtues and Wounds.  
2. **Keep the Mission Log** – After each mission, players record what happened, what was learned, and any Virtue shifts.  
3. **Narrator Guides with Tracker** – Use `mission-tracker.md` to frame each mission’s flow: Aftermath, Tasks, Challenge, Climax, Resolution.  
4. **Record the Chronicle** – Over time, fill `campaign-chronicle.md` with relics, scars, blessings, and memories. This becomes the book of the fellowship.  
5. **Call on the Saints** – Use `saints-quick-roll.md` when the fellowship invokes holy aid. Roll or choose the saint.
