## Relics  

| Relic Name | Slots | Story of Discovery | Current Keeper |  
| ---------- | ----- | ------------------ | -------------- |  
|            |       |                    |                |  
|            |       |                    |                |  

✠ *Relics occupy slots as surely as timber or food, though their weight is holy. Each relic bears a tale — write it here, that memory may endure.*

## Special Notes  

✠ Record blessings, burdens, or changes that affect inventory (such as the Bear’s strength, storms that spoil food, or saints who multiply provisions).
