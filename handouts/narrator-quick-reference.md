## Scene Flow  

✠ The sacred order of every mission:  

Aftermath → Tasks or Social → Community Challenge → Climax → Resolution  

---

## Conversion – *Humans Only*  

- Roll **d20 + Virtue vs Defense (Measure)**.  
- **Success**: foe repents; acting pilgrim gains +1 Charity *or* +1 Hope.  
- **If all convert and none are slain**: all pilgrims gain +1 Faith.  
- **Failure**: the foe resists; backlash is narrated.  
- **Major Failure**: mocked or scorned; roll upon the Consequence Table.  

✠ *Beasts and demons cannot be converted; only men may repent.*  

---

## Supernatural Rule  

- ✠ Supernatural foes cannot be overcome by steel alone.  
- Requires **Faith-based ability, a relic, or Intercession** for final victory.  
- Many are banished rather than slain.
