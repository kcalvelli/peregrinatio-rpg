# Introduction

In nomine Domini nostri Iesu Christi

Peregrinatio is a roleplaying game set in the year 870 AD, when Viking encampments became lasting threats, monasteries faced hardship, and pilgrims journeyed across Christendom.

Its name comes from peregrinatio pro Christo, exile for Christ. Holy men and women left home and kin, sailing into unknown lands with no expectation of return, trusting only in Providence. To live as a pilgrim was to embrace challenge and sanctity, carrying the Gospel or preserving it amid uncertainty.

You embody such wanderers: monks driven from their homes, exiles seeking safety, scribes who defend memory, and defenders who shield the vulnerable. Together you carry a fragile flame—Faith, Hope, and Charity—through a land of trial.

The game is:
- Simple: Roll a d20 plus one Virtue.
- Narrative: Failure always moves the story.
- Orthodox in spirit: Prayer, fasting, and the intercession of the saints sustain the traveler.

You will need: a narrator, 2 to 4 players, one d20, and paper or character sheets.

# Chapter 1 - The Core of the Game

Virtue is wealth more precious than gold.

## Virtues
- Begin at 1 in Faith, 1 in Hope, 1 in Charity.
- Range 0 to 3. Growth can increase your cap to 4.
- Virtues are your only modifiers.
- They rise or fall with choices in play, but never below 0 or above your current cap.

## Dice
- Roll d20 plus one Virtue when the outcome is uncertain.
- DC guide: 10 easy; 12 to 14 normal; 15 to 16 hard; 17 to 18 heroic.
- Success: make progress. Remove a step from an enemy, fill or remove a step on a track, or simply achieve the intent.
- Failure: no progress plus a setback chosen by the Narrator.
- Major Failure: on a natural 1, or if you miss the DC by 5 or more, roll once on the Consequence table (d12).
- Players roll everything. Enemies never roll.

## Wounds
- Each character has 3 Wounds.
- At 3 Wounds the character is unable to act until healed by Rest, a Reward, Intercession, or an ability such as Healing Hands.

## Steps, Tracks, and Defense
- Tasks and journeys use Progress Tracks with 3 to 5 steps. On success you fill a step; on failure the track may grow longer or trigger a setback.
- Enemies have Steps (their durability) and Defense (the DC to affect them). On success you remove steps. At 0 steps the enemy is routed, captured, or banished depending on type.

## Intercession of the Saints
Once per mission, the party may call on the saints. See the Appendix for the d20 Intercession table with short invocations and effects. Intercession is scene-shaping: guarantee a success, cancel a disaster, bring aid, or restore unity and hope.

# Chapter 3 - Scene Types

## Combat
Enemies have Steps and Defense. Success removes steps. At 0 steps they are routed, captured, slain, or banished as appropriate.
- Human foes: may be fought and can be ended by Repentance and Conversion.
- Beasts: may be fought and slain; cannot convert.
- Supernatural foes: cannot be overcome by mundane weapons alone. At least one Faith-based ability, a relic, or Intercession must affect them to achieve final victory. Many are banished rather than killed.

## Tasks
Foraging, building, healing, copying texts, scavenging. Use Progress Tracks with 3 to 5 steps and a DC. Success fills steps; failure may lengthen the track or impose setbacks.

## Social
Disputes, diplomacy, reconciliation. Use a short track or single rolls with Hope or Charity. Conversion attempts may apply when appropriate (humans only).

## Rest
Prayer, confession, fasting, almsgiving, meals, song, storytelling, and vigil. Each character narrates one practice and recovers 1 point: either heal 1 Wound or regain 1 lost Virtue point.

## Climax
A final testing moment of the mission such as a storm, raid, betrayal, or supernatural foe. Typical DC 13 to 16.

### Repentance and Conversion (humans only)
- Attempt with special abilities: Voice of Peace, Art of Peace, Sworn Oath (merciful), Sea's Whisper (merciful), Scriptural Rebuke (merciful).
- Roll d20 plus the relevant Virtue against the enemy Defense.
- Success: the enemy repents or surrenders. The acting character gains plus 1 Charity or plus 1 Hope.
- Failure: the enemy resists; narrate backlash.
- Major Failure: mocked or rebuffed; roll once on the Consequence table.
- End combat if half the enemies convert or surrender.
- If all enemies convert and no one is slain, all characters gain plus 1 Faith.

## Historical Note - Peregrinatio pro Christo
Exile for Christ in early medieval Christianity, especially Ireland, was a way of sanctity in which holy wanderers left homeland for God. The peregrini carried manuscripts, founded monasteries abroad, and traveled in faith. Examples include St. Columba to Iona and St. Brendan on legendary voyages.

In game terms: travel light, trust Providence, face peril with prayer. That is the heart of Peregrinatio.

# Colophon

Here ends Peregrinatio, the game of exile and pilgrimage.

If there be error, it is from man; if there be truth, it is from God.
Pray for those who wrote it, and for those who play it,
that all may finish their own pilgrimage in Christ.

Kyrie eleison.

Amen
