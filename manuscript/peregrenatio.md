# Introduction  

✠ *In nomine Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui est via et veritas et vita.*  

**Peregrinatio** is a sacred game of story, set in the Year of Our Lord 870,  
when the Northmen raised their encampments as enduring threats,  
monasteries lay under affliction, and pilgrims journeyed across Christendom.  

Its name is drawn from the holy path of *peregrinatio pro Christo* —  
exile for the sake of Christ.  
Holy men and women set forth from hearth and kin,  
sailing into strange lands with no hope of return,  
trusting only in divine Providence.  
To live as a pilgrim was to embrace both hardship and sanctity,  
bearing the Gospel, or guarding it in the shadow of uncertainty.  

Here you embody such wanderers:  
monastics driven from their cloisters,  
exiles seeking haven,  
scribes who keep memory against the teeth of fire,  
and champions who shield the weak.  
Together you bear a fragile flame — **Faith, Hope, and Charity** —  
through a land of trial.  

The game is thus:  

✠ **Simple** — Cast a d20 and add one Virtue.  
✠ **Narrative** — Even in failure, the story moves forward.  
✠ **Orthodox in spirit** — Prayer, fasting, and the intercession of the saints  
sustain the pilgrim upon the way.  

✠ You will need: a narrator, two to four fellow pilgrims, one d20,  
and a sheet to mark the journey. 


---

# Liber Primus – De Radice Ludi  

*On the Core of the Game*  

✠ Virtue is wealth more precious than gold.  

## Virtues  

✠ Begin at 1 in Faith, 1 in Hope, 1 in Charity.  
✠ Range is from 0 to 3; Growth may increase the cap to 4.  
✠ Virtues are the only modifiers.  
✠ They rise or fall with choices in play, but never fall below 0 nor rise above the current cap.  

## Dice  

✠ Roll a d20 plus one Virtue when the outcome is uncertain.  
✠ Guide to the Measure: 10 easy; 12–14 normal; 15–16 hard; 17–18 heroic.  
✠ Success: make progress — remove a step from an enemy, fill or remove a step on a track, or achieve the intent.  
✠ Failure: no progress, plus a setback chosen by the Narrator.  
✠ Major Failure: on a natural 1, or if the roll misses the Measure by 5 or more, cast once upon the Consequence table (d12).  
✠ Players roll everything; enemies never roll.  

## Wounds  

✠ Each character bears 3 Wounds.  
✠ At 3 Wounds the pilgrim is unable to act until healed by Rest, Reward, Intercession, or a holy ability such as Healing Hands.  

## Steps, Tracks, and Defense  

✠ Tasks and journeys are measured by Progress Tracks of 3 to 5 steps. On success, fill a step; on failure the track may lengthen or cause setback.  
✠ Enemies possess Steps (their measure of endurance) and Defense (the Measure required to affect them). On success, remove steps.  
✠ At 0 steps the enemy is routed, captured, or banished according to its nature.  

## Intercession of the Saints  

✠ Once in each mission, the fellowship may call upon the saints.  
✠ See the Appendix for the d20 Intercession table with short invocations and their effects.  
✠ Intercession is scene-shaping: it may guarantee a success, cancel a disaster, bring aid, or restore unity and hope.  


---

# Liber Secundus – De Personis et Sociis  

*On Characters and Companions*  

✠ There are four archetypes.  
✠ Each bears 2 combat abilities and 2 non-combat abilities.  
✠ Each is joined by one companion, who offers 1 combat gift and 1 non-combat gift.  
✠ Companion gifts are usable once per scene unless noted otherwise.  

✠ Conversion-eligible abilities are: Voice of Peace, Art of Peace, Sworn Oath (merciful intent), Sea’s Whisper (merciful intent), Scriptural Rebuke (merciful intent).  
✠ Only humans may be converted.  

---

## Knight *(Companion: Hound)*  

**Role**: Defender, oath-keeper, rallying presence.  

**Combat**  
✠ *Shield Wall (Hope)* — Protect an ally for this round. On success the next enemy action against them fails.  
✠ *Cleave (Faith)* — Strike decisively. On success remove 1 step. If you exceed the Measure by 5 or more, remove 2 steps instead.  

**Non-combat**  
✠ *Command Presence (Hope)* — Rally an ally. On success one ally regains 1 Hope.  
✠ *Sworn Oath (Faith)* — Bind yourself to a vow. Use to bolster trust, frighten foes, or attempt conversion against a human Measure.  

**Hound**  
✠ *Bite (combat)* — Remove 1 step. Once per scene.  
✠ *Keen Senses (non-combat)* — Auto-succeed at locating hidden threats or tracks.  

---

## Navigator *(Companion: Seal)*  

**Role**: Explorer, survivor, pathfinder.  

**Combat**  
✠ *Tide-Turner (Hope)* — Negate one enemy success or narrative advantage this round.  
✠ *Harpoon Thrust (Faith)* — On success remove 1 step.  

**Non-combat**  
✠ *Wayfinder (Faith)* — Chart safe passage. On success skip 1 journey step or reduce the next travel Measure by 2.  
✠ *Sea’s Whisper (Hope)* — Words that still fear. Attempt conversion or reduce the Social Measure by 2 for the scene.  

**Seal**  
✠ *Seal’s Slam (combat)* — Remove 1 step. Once per scene. Works on land or sea.  
✠ *Harbor Friend (non-combat)* — Auto-succeed at finding shelter or safe anchorage.  

---

## Monastic *(Companion: Bear)*  

**Role**: Healer, builder, reconciler.  

**Combat**  
✠ *Staff Strike (Faith)* — On success remove 1 step.  
✠ *Healing Hands (Charity)* — Instead of attacking, heal 1 Wound. If the target was at 0 Wounds, also restore 1 Hope.  

**Non-combat**  
✠ *Mender of Walls (Faith)* — Auto-complete one step of a building or repair task.  
✠ *Voice of Peace (Hope)* — Reconcile or convert. Gain minus 2 to the Measure when attempting conversion.  

**Bear**  
✠ *Bear’s Charge (combat)* — Remove one enemy from the scene entirely. Once per scene.  
✠ *Beast of Burden (non-combat)* — The party gains plus 3 inventory slots while traveling with the Bear.  

---

## Illuminator *(Companion: Cat)*  

**Role**: Artist, scribe, visionary.  

**Combat**  
✠ *Living Art (Hope)* — Your art becomes a visible holy illusion that inspires allies or frightens foes. On success, either grant plus 1 Hope to all allies this round or remove 1 step from one enemy.  
✠ *Scriptural Rebuke (Faith)* — Speak sacred words. Banish 1 step from a supernatural foe or attempt conversion against a human.  

**Non-combat**  
✠ *Art of Peace (Charity)* — Show sacred images that soften hearts. Attempt conversion or reduce the Social Measure by 2.  
✠ *Illuminated Record (Faith)* — Chronicle the mission. One ally regains 1 Hope and the party gains an advantageous memory. Once later, gain plus 2 to a closely related test.  

**Cat**  
✠ *Distracting Claws (combat)* — One enemy loses 1 action. Once per scene.  
✠ *Silent Observer (non-combat)* — Auto-succeed at uncovering anything hidden, including motives, traps, secret stashes, and ambushes.  

---

# Liber Tertius – De Scenis Variis  

*On the Kinds of Scenes*  

✠ Every mission unfolds through scenes. Some are of strife, some of labor, some of speech, and some of holy rest. In each, the Virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity guide the hand of the pilgrim.  

---

## Combat  

✠ Enemies bear both *Steps* and *Defense*. A success removes steps. At 0 steps they are routed, captured, slain, or banished according to their nature.  

✠ Types of foes:  

- **Human foes** — May be fought in arms, but also ended by Repentance and Conversion if mercy prevails.  
- **Beasts** — May be fought and slain, but they cannot be converted.  
- **Supernatural foes** — Spirits, demons, wraiths, or dark portents cannot be overcome by mundane steel alone. At least one Faith-based ability, a relic, or Intercession must strike them to achieve final victory. Many are banished rather than killed outright.  

---

## Tasks  

✠ Tasks include foraging, building, healing, copying sacred texts, and scavenging.  
✠ They are measured by *Progress Tracks* of 3 to 5 steps.  
✠ Success fills steps; failure may lengthen the track or impose setbacks as the Narrator decrees.  

---

## Social  

✠ Disputes, diplomacy, and reconciliation are the work of Charity and Hope.  
✠ Use a short Progress Track or single rolls.  
✠ Conversion attempts may apply when fitting (humans only).  
✠ In such scenes, words may bear more weight than steel.  

---

## Rest  

✠ Rest is more than sleep. It is prayer, confession, fasting, almsgiving, meals, song, storytelling, and vigil.  
✠ Each pilgrim narrates one holy or humble practice of rest.  
✠ Thereby recover 1 point: either heal 1 Wound or regain 1 lost Virtue.  
✠ Rest renews the company for the road yet to come.  

---

## Climax  

✠ At the end of a mission comes the *Climax*, the final trial: storm, raid, betrayal, or a foe of darkness.  
✠ The Measure is often 13 to 16, representing a hard or heroic test.  
✠ The Climax decides the fruit of the journey and reveals whether Faith, Hope, and Charity endure.  

---

## Repentance and Conversion *(humans only)*  

✠ Conversion is not a common act, but a holy mystery.  

- Attempt with these abilities: **Voice of Peace**, **Art of Peace**, **Sworn Oath** (merciful), **Sea’s Whisper** (merciful), **Scriptural Rebuke** (merciful).  
- Roll d20 plus the relevant Virtue against the enemy’s *Defense*.  
- **Success**: the enemy repents or surrenders. The acting character gains +1 Charity or +1 Hope.  
- **Failure**: the enemy resists; narrate backlash or hardened hearts.  
- **Major Failure**: the pilgrim is mocked or rebuffed; roll once on the Consequence table.  

✠ Combat ends if half the enemies convert or surrender.  
✠ If all enemies convert and none are slain, then all characters gain +1 Faith, for mercy has triumphed.  

✠ Not eligible: Beasts and all supernatural foes cannot be converted. Their defeat comes by other means.  

---

# Liber Quartus – De Fructu et Poena  

*On Consequences and Rewards*  

✠ Every deed bears fruit: some sweet, some bitter. When the Measure is missed by much, or when fate casts down the pilgrim, turn to the Consequence table. When triumph or blessing comes, turn to the Reward table. Thus the hand of Providence is shown both in hardship and in gift.  

---

## Consequence Table (d12)  

| Roll | Result                  | Effect                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Wounded**             | Suffer 1 Wound.                                              |
| 2    | **Shaken Faith**        | Lose 1 Faith (minimum 0).                                    |
| 3    | **Sapped Hope**         | Lose 1 Hope (minimum 0).                                     |
| 4    | **Chilled Charity**     | Lose 1 Charity (minimum 0).                                  |
| 5    | **Companion Imperiled** | Companion cannot act in the next scene unless aided.         |
| 6    | **Omen of Doom**        | The next Measure is increased by +2.                         |
| 7    | **Supplies Lost**       | Lose 1d6 materials.                                          |
| 8    | **Enemy Strengthens**   | Add +1 step to the current foe or track.                     |
| 9    | **Delay**               | Add +1 step to the current non-combat track.                 |
| 10   | **Allies Shaken**       | All characters lose 1 Hope.                                  |
| 11   | **Physical Scar**       | Receive a permanent mark. Once per mission you may call upon it for +2 to a related test, or suffer –1 Hope if it haunts you. |
| 12   | **Spiritual Scar**      | The first Faith roll each mission suffers –2 until resolved; resolving it grants +1 Faith. |

✠ Thus are trials made manifest in the flesh, the spirit, and the fellowship.  

---

## Reward Table (d12)  

| Roll | Reward                     | Effect                                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Mended**                 | Restore 1 Wound.                                             |
| 2    | **Faith Renewed**          | Gain +1 Faith, up to your cap.                               |
| 3    | **Hope Rekindled**         | Gain +1 Hope.                                                |
| 4    | **Charity Deepened**       | Gain +1 Charity.                                             |
| 5    | **Ally Joins**             | A helper accompanies you for one mission, assisting once per scene. |
| 6    | **Supplies Found**         | Gain 1d6 materials.                                          |
| 7    | **Relic Fragment**         | While held, once per mission cancel a Consequence roll.      |
| 8    | **Community Blessing**     | A community prays; all characters gain +1 Hope.              |
| 9    | **Vision or Dream**        | Prophetic hint; once next mission, gain +2 to a roll tied to it. |
| 10   | **Hidden Knowledge**       | Treat one target’s Defense as 2 less, once.                  |
| 11   | **Companion Strengthened** | Use a companion gift twice this mission.                     |
| 12   | **Communal Feast**         | All characters gain +1 Hope and remove 1 step from one community problem. |

✠ Thus are pilgrims strengthened by Providence, whether by healing of body, deepening of soul, or the blessing of fellowship.  

---

## Growth *(every three missions)*  

✠ At the end of three missions, each pilgrim may grow in grace. Choose one:  

✠ **Deepen a Virtue** — Raise the cap by +1, to a maximum of 4.  
✠ **New Ability** — Gain a new ability fitting your archetype.  
✠ **Strengthen a Companion** — Improve one gift, or allow it to be used twice per mission.  
✠ **Relic or Blessing** — Receive a relic or enduring blessing of the company.  
✠ **Pilgrim’s Blessing** *(special, once per campaign)* — Permanently lose 1 inventory slot, traveling lighter; gain +1 to one Intercession effect in each mission henceforth.  

---

✠ In this way the story of the pilgrim is shaped: by wounds and by wonders, by scars and by blessings, until the final home is reached.  

# Liber Quintus – De Ordine Missionum  

*On the Flow of a Mission*  

✠ A mission is not mere wandering, but a sacred ordering of events. Just as the liturgy has its beginning, offering, and dismissal, so too does each mission bear its own holy rhythm. What follows is the order of play, that the pilgrims may keep their path straight and their purpose clear.  

---

## I. Aftermath and Assessment  

✠ Every mission begins in the shadow of loss or danger. Something is broken, threatened, or imperiled: food stores lie empty, shelter lies in ruins, relics have been stolen, or the spirit of the community has faltered.  

✠ In this phase:  

- The Narrator describes the wound of the world.  
- The fellowship discerns what must be restored, defended, or mended.  
- Each player may speak their pilgrim’s first response — grief, resolve, prayer, or action.  

✠ Thus the stage is set, and the road ahead is made known.  

---

## II. Tasks and Social Conflicts  

✠ Having seen the wound, the pilgrims set to work. Here unfold the labors of hands and the labors of speech.  

**Tasks may include:**  
✠ Foraging for food and supplies.  
✠ Building or repairing homes, walls, boats, or churches.  
✠ Healing the sick and tending the wounded.  
✠ Copying sacred texts, preserving memory against flame and time.  
✠ Scavenging ruins or wilds for what is lost.  

**Social conflicts may include:**  
✠ Reconciling quarrels within the village.  
✠ Persuading others to stay steadfast when fear tempts them to flee.  
✠ Speaking peace to those who demand vengeance.  
✠ Beseeching aid from neighbors or strangers.  

✠ These scenes are measured by Progress Tracks, brief exchanges, or single rolls, according to their weight.  

---

## III. The Community Challenge  

✠ Beyond the work of hands and voices, there arises a deeper question: what path shall the people walk?  

✠ This is the *Community Challenge*, the fork in the road that tests the soul:  

- Shall the villagers **stay** and rebuild, or **flee** to safety?  
- Shall they **forgive** their foes, or **retaliate** with fire and steel?  
- Shall they **share** their meager stores, or **hoard** them in fear?  
- Shall they **submit** to foreign rule, or **defy** it with peril?  

✠ Here Hope and Charity weigh heavily. Success brings unity, while failure may deepen division. The Narrator may set a Progress Track or call for a single Measure.  

✠ The Community Challenge shapes not only the present mission, but the memory of the people in missions to come.  

---

## IV. The Climax  

✠ No mission ends in quiet. A storm gathers — of nature, of men, or of spirits.  

**Examples include:**  
✠ A sudden storm that threatens to wash away boats or fields.  
✠ A Viking raid, swift and merciless.  
✠ A betrayal from within the village, revealed at the worst moment.  
✠ The rising of a supernatural foe: a draugr, a spirit of the woods, or a demon that mocks holy things.  

✠ The Climax is the final testing. The Measure is often 13 to 16, demanding courage and unity. Success brings deliverance; failure may wound deeply, but always moves the tale forward.  

✠ The Narrator describes the rising peril, each pilgrim declares their stand, and the dice are cast.  

---

## V. Resolution  

✠ When the storm has passed, whether in triumph or in trial, the mission comes to rest.  

**In Resolution:**  
✠ The fellowship narrates how they take rest: prayer, confession, fasting, almsgiving, meal, song, storytelling, vigil.  
✠ Each pilgrim recovers one point — heal 1 Wound or regain 1 lost Virtue.  
✠ Roll once upon the Consequence Table, to mark the scars of the journey.  
✠ Roll once upon the Reward Table, to taste its blessings.  
✠ Record changes to the village, the fellowship, and any Virtue shifts that came through choice or trial.  

✠ Thus the story of the mission is bound up like a codex leaf, ready for the next to be written.  

---

✠ *So ends the order of missions. Let the fellowship keep it faithfully, that their tale may be told with grace and with clarity.*  



# Liber Sextus – De Itineris Vestigiis  

*On Tracking the Journey*  

✠ No pilgrimage is without its record. The saints themselves kept annals of deeds and wonders, that those who came after might take courage. So too must this game be kept in memory, lest the labor of the fellowship fade like smoke.  

---

## The Mission Tracker *(for the Narrator)*  

✠ The Narrator bears the greater burden, for they must oversee the unfolding of each mission. To aid this, keep a Mission Tracker:  

- **Threats** — What perils endanger the village, the company, or the land itself.  
- **Tasks** — The labors appointed: foraging, building, healing, reconciling, persuading.  
- **Enemies** — The foes, whether human, beast, or spirit, with their Steps and their Measure.  
- **Climax** — The trial that rises at the mission’s end, be it storm, raid, betrayal, or foe of darkness.  
- **Resolution** — How the fellowship rested, what wounds remained, and what blessings were received.  

✠ The Mission Tracker is the Narrator’s ledger, not for beauty but for clarity. It ensures the flow of the mission follows the ordained order.  

---

## The Mission Log *(for the Players)*  

✠ The players, too, keep record, that their wanderings not be forgotten. This is the *Mission Log*, written as though in the margin of a codex or on a scrap preserved from fire.  

✠ Each entry should note:  

- **What was broken** — food lost, homes destroyed, relics defiled, morale shaken.  
- **What was done** — the labors attempted, both successes and failures.  
- **What was learned** — new knowledge, wisdom, or alliances gained.  
- **Virtue shifts** — Faith, Hope, and Charity rising or falling with choice and trial.  

✠ The Mission Log is less a list than a remembrance. Each player may contribute, so that many hands preserve the flame.  

---

## The Campaign Chronicle *(for all together)*  

✠ Beyond the single mission lies the whole journey: the *Campaign Chronicle*. This is no mere tally, but a living hagiography — the sacred biography of the fellowship.  

✠ In it record:  

- **Missions** — their beginnings, labors, and ends.  
- **Relics** — found, guarded, or lost along the way.  
- **Scars** — wounds of body or spirit, carried forward as signs of trial.  
- **Blessings** — those received through prayer, feast, dream, or Providence.  
- **Saints invoked** — whose aid was sought and whose intercessions turned the tide.  

✠ The Campaign Chronicle should be kept with solemnity, for in time it becomes a book of remembrance. Like the Lives of the Saints, it tells not only of trials and victories, but of faith endured unto the end.  

---

✠ *Thus are the vestiges of the journey preserved: in the Narrator’s careful hand, in the players’ own log, and in the grand Chronicle of the company. Let none be forgotten, for memory is the soil in which Hope grows anew.*  

# Liber Septimus – De Bestiis et Hostibus  

*On Beasts and Adversaries*  

✠ Every foe that rises against the pilgrim has its measure: *Steps* (the endurance of the enemy) and *Defense* (the Measure needed to strike it true). Most adversaries bear between 2 and 6 Steps, and a Defense from 12 to 18.  

✠ Enemies fall into three orders: **Natural Beasts**, **Human Foes**, and **Supernatural Powers**. Each must be met in its own way.  

---

## Natural Beasts  

✠ Beasts are the trials of the wild. They cannot be converted, for they lack reason, yet they test courage and patience.  

- **Wolves** — Steps 2–3, Measure 12–14. They fight in packs. On a failed roll, lose 1 Hope as their howls surround you.  
- **Bear** — Steps 4, Measure 14–15. A creature of massive strength. On failure, suffer 1 Wound from its mauling.  
- **Serpent** — Steps 2, Measure 12. Strikes with venom. On failure, suffer –2 to the next roll, for fear courses through you.  

✠ Beasts fall by endurance and steadfastness, but not by conversion.  

---

## Human Foes  

✠ Men, unlike beasts, may harden their hearts in cruelty or turn in repentance. Thus mercy is possible.  

- **Raider** — Steps 2–4, Measure 12–14. May be fought or converted. If half surrender or repent, the rest break.  
- **Chieftain** — Steps 5, Measure 15–16. Commands lesser men. Conversion is possible, but at +2 to the Measure, for the pride of rulers is great.  

✠ Human foes remind the pilgrim that even the enemy may be a soul to save, if mercy prevails.  

---

## Supernatural Powers *(Irish)*  

✠ The Psalmist declares: *“For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.”* (Psalm 96:5, LXX).  
✠ Therefore, supernatural adversaries cannot be overcome by mundane weapons alone. They yield only to Faith, to relics, or to Intercession. Many are banished rather than slain.  

- **The Morrígan’s Shade** — Steps 5, Measure 16. A crow-wreathed woman, demon of battle and fate.  
  - *Fearful Cry* — On failure, all who hear lose 1 Hope.  
  - *Wings of Shadow* — Negates one success until countered by Faith.  
  - Banished by Faith, relic, or Intercession.  

- **Crom Cruach (Idol)** — Steps 6, Measure 17. A demon bound to a shattered idol of blood sacrifice.  
  - *Hunger for Blood* — Each failure inflicts 1 Wound.  
  - *Unholy Ground* — The Measure rises by +2 near the shrine.  
  - Banished only by relic or Intercession.  

- **Lugh’s Echo** — Steps 4, Measure 15. A trickster demon aping a warrior god.  
  - *Deception* — Forces a reroll of one success per scene.  
  - *Boastful Illusion* — Spawns false enemies as narrative pressure.  
  - Banished by rebuke in Truth through Faith, or by Intercession.  

- **Púca** — Steps 3, Measure 14. A malevolent shape-shifter, often horse, goat, or hound with burning eyes.  
  - *Deception* — Misleads travelers.  
  - *Fearful Glare* — On failure, lose 1 Hope.  
  - Weakness: truthful prayer and naming Christ.  

- **Banshee (Bean Sí)** — Steps 2, Measure 13. An omen of death, keening at night.  
  - *Wail of Mourning* — On failure, the acting pilgrim loses 1 Charity.  
  - *Presence of Doom* — If ignored, add +1 step to the next enemy or track.  
  - Released by confession or blessing.  

- **Dullahan** — Steps 4, Measure 15. The headless rider, herald of death.  
  - *Death’s Gaze* — Once per scene, a target loses 1 Hope.  
  - *Unstoppable Ride* — Ignores barriers and gates.  
  - Driven off by relics or psalmody.  

- **Water Horse (Each Uisce)** — Steps 3, Measure 14. A river demon in the guise of a steed, luring mortals to drown.  
  - *Drowning Grip* — On failure, inflict 1 Wound.  
  - *Illusory Allure* — Appears harmless until touched.  
  - Weakness: psalms or holy water.

✠ *Thus are the enemies of the pilgrim named: beasts of the wild, men of hardened heart, and spirits of deception and terror. Against each, the pilgrim must choose rightly: whether to fight, to show mercy, or to banish by Faith. Blessed is he whose hand is guided by Charity, whose courage is girded with Hope, and whose victory is sealed in Faith.*  

- # Liber Octavus – Exempla Ludorum  

  *Examples of Play*  

  ✠ As the monks of old wrote exempla — short tales to guide the faithful — so here are given exempla of play. Each shows not only the rolling of dice, but the words of the pilgrims and the manner of their choices, so that all may see how Faith, Hope, and Charity govern both story and fellowship.  

  ---

  ## I. Combat with Conversion  

  **Setup**: Three raiders, each with 2 Steps and a Measure of 13. They fall upon a village at dawn.  

  - ✠ *Knight* raises the Shield Wall (Hope). The player says: *“Stand behind me, and no axe shall strike you this day.”* Roll: 16 vs 13. Success. The ally is kept safe.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* invokes the Art of Peace (Charity). The player says: *“Look upon this holy image, and remember mercy before blood.”* Roll: 11 vs 13. Failure. The raider scoffs at the icon.  
  - ✠ *Monastic* lifts the Voice of Peace (Hope). The player says: *“Brother, you need not die in sin. Lay down your weapon.”* Roll: 18 vs 13. Success. One raider repents and drops his sword.  

  **Result**: The other raiders, seeing this, falter and flee.  

  **Reward**: The Monastic gains +1 Charity. Because the fight ended in repentance with none slain, all gain +1 Faith.  

  **Lesson**: Mercy spoken with courage may end strife more surely than steel.  

  ---

  ## II. Task: Foraging and Building  

  **Track**: Rebuild the chapel — 4 Steps, Measure 12, with gathered materials required. The ruins smoke, and the villagers weep.  

  - ✠ *Navigator* goes to forage. The player says: *“I will walk the wooded hills and see what timber may be cut.”* Roll Faith: success; 1d6 = 3 wood found.  
  - ✠ *Monastic* acts as Mender of Walls. The player says: *“These stones shall not lie scattered. By Christ’s strength I will raise them again.”* Auto-complete 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* encourages with Hope. The player says: *“Take heart, brethren! See how even the ashes will frame a greater glory.”* Roll: success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Hound* sniffs the earth and barks. The Narrator says: *“In the undergrowth, the dog finds more timber, enough for another beam.”*  

  **Result**: The steps are filled, materials spent, and the chapel’s frame stands once more.  

  **Lesson**: Each pilgrim brings a gift, whether of strength, art, or instinct.  

  ---

  ## III. Social Conflict: Stay or Flee  

  **Track**: Persuade the villagers to remain — 4 Steps, Measure 14. Fear weighs heavy.  

  - ✠ *Knight* swears an Oath (Faith). The player declares: *“By my sword, no foe shall breach these walls again.”* Roll: fail. He loses 1 Faith, for his words ring hollow.  
  - ✠ *Monastic* speaks the Voice of Peace (Hope). The player says: *“Do not let vengeance master you, nor fear scatter you. Christ is our shelter.”* Roll: success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* shows the Art of Peace (Charity). The player says: *“Look upon these images — not ruins, but seeds of hope. Let us make beauty where there was ash.”* Success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Navigator* whispers the Sea’s Voice (Hope). The player says: *“As tides rise and fall, so too shall this village rise.”* Failure; the villagers mutter in doubt.  
  - ✠ *Cat* prowls and uncovers hidden grain. The Narrator says: *“The cat scratches at a granary door, revealing hidden stores. Hope is restored.”* Step filled.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* repeats, speaking tenderly to the youngest. *“Stay, children. You are the heart of this place.”* Success; the final step filled.  

  **Result**: The village chooses to remain and rebuild.  

  **Lesson**: Hope kindled in small ways may outweigh fear.  

  ---

  ## IV. Exploration: Crossing the Bog  

  **Track**: 3 Steps, Measure 13. The bog is treacherous, mist-shrouded.  

  - ✠ *Navigator* as Wayfinder (Faith). Player: *“I know the stars above and the moss at my feet. Follow me.”* Success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Knight* guards the rear (Hope). Player: *“No one strays behind while I watch.”* Failure; a villager wanders.  
  - ✠ *Seal* acts with Harbor Friend. Narrator: *“The seal’s spirit leads you to hummocks of safety.”* Step filled.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* records the path (Faith). Player: *“By ink and symbol I mark the way, so none shall be lost again.”* Success; fills the final step.  

  **Result**: The crossing is safe. Future travelers may benefit from the record.  

  **Lesson**: Even danger becomes a map when marked with care.  

  ---

  ## V. Diplomacy: Parley with a Chieftain  

  **Track**: Convince the chieftain to aid — 4 Steps, Measure 15. The warlord eyes the pilgrims with suspicion.  

  - ✠ *Illuminator* shows the Art of Peace (Charity). Player: *“See, noble one, the beauty of peace.”* Failure; she loses 1 Charity.  
  - ✠ *Monastic* raises the Voice of Peace (Hope). Player: *“We come not as foes but as brothers. Do not harden your heart.”* Success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Knight* swears an Oath (Faith). Player: *“On my life, I will guard this pact with my blood.”* Success; fills 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Navigator* offers a gift (Hope). Player: *“Take this salt fish from the sea, a token of goodwill.”* Failure; the chieftain laughs at the meagerness.  
  - ✠ *Cat* observes silently. Narrator: *“The cat’s unblinking gaze reveals the chieftain’s fear. You seize upon it.”* Step filled.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* repeats, speaking with gentleness. *“Aid us, and your name shall be honored in our songs.”* Success; the final step filled.  

  **Result**: The chieftain agrees to lend aid. All gain +1 Charity.  

  **Lesson**: Courage, oath, and gentle word together may bend even the proud.  

  ---

  ## VI. Supernatural: Banishing the Púca  

  **Foe**: The Púca — 3 Steps, Measure 14. A black horse with burning eyes waits at the ford.  

  - ✠ *Knight* strikes with sword (Faith). Player: *“By steel I drive you back!”* Roll: 12 vs 14. Failure. The Narrator reminds: mundane weapons cannot harm.  
  - ✠ *Navigator* as Wayfinder (Faith). Player: *“Reveal your true form, deceiver!”* Roll: 15. Success; removes 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Monastic* speaks the Voice of Peace (Hope). Player: *“In Christ’s name, depart!”* Roll: 18. Success; removes 1 step.  
  - ✠ *Illuminator* creates Living Art (Hope). Player: *“See this holy light! It shames your shadow.”* Roll: 16. Success; removes the final step.  

  **Result**: The Púca shatters into mist, fleeing with a scream.  

  **Lesson**: Faith and holy word banish demons; steel alone is vain.  

  ---

  ✠ *So are the exempla written: not merely as rolls and results, but as tales told aloud. Let players speak as their pilgrims, that Faith, Hope, and Charity may live in word as well as deed.*  

# Liber Nonus – De Suppellectili et Copiis  

*On Inventory and Supplies*  

✠ Even the saints bore little, yet what they carried was precious: a psalter, a staff, a cloak, a vessel of water. So too the fellowship must keep account of its possessions. Inventory is not mere tally, but the measure of what Providence has given into the pilgrims’ hands.  

✠ The party’s inventory equals the sum of the slots borne by each pilgrim. Relics, when found, are laid within this same store, occupying space as surely as wood or food.  

- ✠ *Knight* — 10 slots.  
- ✠ *Navigator* — 8 slots.  
- ✠ *Monastic* — 9 slots (plus 3 more while accompanied by the Bear).  
- ✠ *Illuminator* — 7 slots.  

✠ These are the burdens each may bear, no more. If the pilgrims wish to carry more, some burden must be laid aside, or borne by beast or companion.  

---

## Gathering Materials  

✠ As the pilgrims labor, they may forage, scavenge, or salvage. Each success yields 1d6 units, each unit filling 1 slot of inventory.  

**Types of materials**:  

- **Wood** — for building frames, fires, or tools.  
- **Stone** — for walls, hearths, or altars.  
- **Food** — for sustenance in travel or in feast.  
- **Herbs** — for healing draughts and poultices.  
- **Hides or Cloth** — for tents, garments, or bindings.  
- **Ink or Parchment** — for sacred texts or records.  
- **Other** — rare finds of iron, bronze, oil, or whatever Providence grants.  

✠ When a pilgrim succeeds at a foraging roll, let them describe how they gather:  

- The *Navigator* might say: *“I walk the wooded hills and mark the straightest timbers.”*  
- The *Monastic* may say: *“From the ruined cloister I lift stones yet sound.”*  
- The *Illuminator* may say: *“I persuade a scribe to share ink, for the promise of a fair copy.”*  

Thus the gathering becomes story, not ledger.  

---

## Using Materials  

✠ Missions often set requirements of materials, before progress on a task can begin.  

**Example**: *To rebuild the chapel requires 5 Wood, 2 Stone, and 1 Food.*  

- ✠ The *Navigator* rolls success: gathers 3 Wood.  
- ✠ The *Monastic* salvages 2 Stone from the ruins.  
- ✠ The *Illuminator* secures 1 Food by almsgiving.  

✠ The requirements are met, the slots are spent, and the fellowship may proceed to the building track.  

✠ In play, the Narrator should ask each pilgrim to describe how the materials are laid down:  

- *“I shape the timber and lay it true.”*  
- *“I lift the stone into place, chanting psalms as I work.”*  
- *“I share food with the weary so their hands may labor.”*  

---

## The Burden of Relics  

✠ Relics too are stored in the inventory. A relic takes one slot, as surely as a bundle of wood. Yet its weight is more spiritual than material.  

✠ When a relic is carried, let the pilgrim speak of it:  

- *“I bear the fragment of the True Cross at my breast.”*  
- *“I guard the saint’s psalter in waxed cloth.”*  
- *“I carry the bones of the martyr in a wooden casket.”*  

✠ Thus relics become not tokens on a list, but holy burdens that shape story and inspire awe.  

---

✠ *So is inventory kept, not as dry account, but as record of Providence. The fellowship bears wood and stone, bread and ink, relic and memory. To carry less is to travel lighter; to carry more is to bear the weight of the world. May each pilgrim discern wisely what to take upon the road.*  

- # Liber Decimus – De Missionibus  

  *On the Missions Themselves*  

  ✠ A mission is not a mere venture, but a chapter in the pilgrimage of the fellowship. Just as the Psalms weave lament, labor, trial, and praise into a single song, so each mission weaves sorrow, toil, testing, and reward into a living story.  

  ✠ The mission is the measure of play. It gives form to wandering, rhythm to choice, and memory to action. Through it, Faith, Hope, and Charity are tested, deepened, or diminished.  

  ---

  ## The Shape of a Mission  

  Every mission follows the sacred order, like verses of a hymn:  

  1. **Aftermath and Assessment**  
     ✠ Begin in the shadow of loss. A village lies broken, food is scarce, raiders linger, a relic is stolen, or despair has spread.  
     ✠ The Narrator names what is imperiled: food, shelter, memory, or the spirit of the people.  
     ✠ Players describe their first responses: grief, prayer, planning, or defiance.  

  2. **Tasks and Social Conflicts**  
     ✠ Pilgrims labor to heal, to build, to reconcile, to persuade.  
     ✠ Tasks are measured by Progress Tracks: each success fills a step, each failure may lengthen the track or impose setback.  
     ✠ Social conflicts call for words of Hope or Charity, and sometimes for Conversion attempts.  
     ✠ Role-play: *“I will lift stone upon stone,”* says the Monastic. *“I will speak words to calm their anger,”* says the Illuminator.  

  3. **The Community Challenge**  
     ✠ Here the company faces the deeper question: Shall the people stay or flee? Forgive or retaliate? Share or hoard? Submit or resist?  
     ✠ The Narrator frames the choice; the players speak, argue, persuade.  
     ✠ The outcome may shape not only this mission but all to come.  
     ✠ Role-play: *“Stay, for the Lord is our fortress.”* *“No — flee, lest our children perish.”*  

  4. **The Climax**  
     ✠ Every mission ends with trial. The storm breaks, the raiders strike, betrayal is revealed, or a spirit rises.  
     ✠ The Measure is high (13–16), calling forth courage and faith.  
     ✠ Role-play: *“I will stand at the gate, though they strike me down.”* *“I cry out to the saints: aid us!”*  

  5. **Resolution**  
     ✠ After the storm, peace or sorrow follows.  
     ✠ Each character describes rest: prayer, vigil, feast, song.  
     ✠ Roll once on the Consequence table, and once on the Reward table.  
     ✠ Record shifts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and changes to community or inventory.  
     ✠ The chapter is closed, and another awaits.  

  ---

  ## The Purpose of Missions  

  ✠ Each mission binds the threats of the world to the faithful labor of the pilgrims. Where raiders burn, pilgrims rebuild. Where famine strikes, pilgrims forage and share. Where despair spreads, pilgrims console and reconcile. Where demons rise, pilgrims pray and banish.  

  ✠ The Narrator should tie every mission to both peril and grace. A wall may need repair, but the greater need may be healing division. A relic may be recovered, but the greater treasure is renewed Faith.  

  ✠ Missions are not chores, but sacred encounters, where the worldly need becomes a parable of the spiritual journey.  

  ---

  ## Examples of Mission Seeds  

  ✠ **Relics to Recover** — A psalter stolen by raiders, an icon hidden in a marsh, a saint’s relic lost in fire.  
  ✠ **Manuscripts to Copy** — Pages fading, torn, or water-damaged, needing to be preserved.  
  ✠ **Walls to Rebuild** — Cloister, chapel, or village palisade. A task of stone and wood, but also of courage.  
  ✠ **Peace to Broker** — Between chieftains, between families, between those tempted to vengeance and those pleading for mercy.  
  ✠ **Pilgrimage to Undertake** — Carrying relics to a new home, seeking sanctuary in another land, or journeying to a holy well.  
  ✠ **Supernatural Threats** — A demon-haunted ford, a keening banshee, or a shrine corrupted by idols.  

  ---

  ## The Narrator’s Charge  

  ✠ The Narrator is both chronicler and witness. In missions, they weave peril and possibility, so that every choice matters. Their task is not to triumph over players, but to shape the stage where Faith, Hope, and Charity may be tested.  

  ✠ The Narrator must always ask:  

  - What is at stake?  
  - What labors are required?  
  - What division must be healed?  
  - What trial will close the tale?  

  ---

  ## Sample Missions in the Appendices  

  Two missions are given in full in the Appendices, as exempla to guide play:  

  - **Rebuilding the Village** — The aftermath of raid and ruin; food, shelter, and hope must be restored.  
  - **The Lost Relic (The Morrígan’s Shade)** — A mission of peril and faith: the recovery of a relic haunted by a demon of battle and fate.  

  ✠ These serve as patterns, like illuminations in a manuscript, that others may follow and adapt. The Narrator may weave new missions after their likeness, adding trial, blessing, and memory.  

  ---

  ✠ *So is the order of missions revealed: aftermath, labor, challenge, climax, and rest. Each is a chapter in the fellowship’s living hagiography. Let the players speak as pilgrims, act with Faith, Hope, and Charity, and so write their own book of exile and return.*  


---



# Appendicia – The Additional Matters  

✠ In every codex there are matters set aside at the end: teachings, glosses, prayers, and guides. What follows are additions for the fellowship, that their play may be shaped not only by dice, but by prayer, memory, and the witness of the saints.  

---

## Orthodox Practices in Play  

✠ The life of the pilgrim is not only trial but also discipline. These holy practices may be woven into play, especially in the time of Rest. They grant small blessings, but more importantly they invite players to speak and act as pilgrims of God.  

- **Prayer**  
  ✠ During Rest, a pilgrim may pray. Gain +1 Faith once per Rest.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”*  

- **Confession**  
  ✠ Always before a priest. If one is present, a pilgrim may confess a *Spiritual Scar*. By sincere confession, it is turned into +1 Faith.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“Father, forgive me, for I have stumbled. In weakness I fell, but I seek mercy.”*  

- **Blessing**  
  ✠ Only priests may bless. Once per scene, a priest’s blessing may grant +2 to one roll.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *The priest lifts his hand, saying: “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, be strengthened.”*  

- **Fasting**  
  ✠ During Rest, a pilgrim may fast. Gain +1 Hope in the next scene, but the first physical test is at –2.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“I will take no food, that I may hunger for God alone.”*  

- **Almsgiving**  
  ✠ Give scarce goods to the poor. Immediately gain +1 Charity, and advantage on the next Social scene.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“Take this food, though I myself have little, for Christ comes to us hungry.”*  

- **Meals**  
  ✠ A shared meal after hardship restores +1 Hope to all.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“Come, sit and eat. We have survived, and together we are strong.”*  

- **Song and Story**  
  ✠ Recounting deeds restores +1 Hope to one ally and reduces the next Social Measure by 1.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“Let me tell of how you stood at the gate, and no foe passed by.”*  

- **Vigil**  
  ✠ Keep watch in prayer. One pilgrim may reroll a failed Faith test in the next scene.  
  ✠ Roleplay: *“All sleep, but I will stand with my candle lit, whispering psalms into the night.”*  

✠ These practices remind players that rest is not idleness, but the very heart of perseverance.  

---

## Historical Note – *Peregrinatio pro Christo*  

✠ In the early centuries of the faith, exile for Christ — *peregrinatio pro Christo* — was a path of sanctity. Holy wanderers left homeland and kin, sailing into the unknown with no expectation of return, seeking only to live and die in the Lord.  

✠ From Ireland arose many such: St. Columba who sailed to Iona, St. Columbanus who founded monasteries on the Continent, St. Brendan who voyaged into seas half-legend. They carried manuscripts, founded communities, and trusted Providence in peril.  

✠ In game terms:  

- Travel light.  
- Trust Providence.  
- Face peril with prayer.  

✠ This is the heart of *Peregrinatio*: exile not as punishment, but as holy calling.  

---

## Intercession of the Saints – d20 Table with Short Prayers  

✠ The fellowship may once per mission invoke the saints. Speak the prayer aloud, roll the die, and apply the blessing. These invocations are shortened for play, yet retain the spirit of ancient petitions.  

|  d20 | Saint                         | Short Invocation                                             | Effect                                              |
| ---: | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |

|    7 | **St. James**                 | “Holy James, first pilgrim, walk with us on the road.”       | Restore 1 Wound to all allies.                      |
|    8 | **St. Patrick**               | “Christ with us… holy Patrick, guard us.”                    | Lorica: all PCs prevent 1 Wound this scene.         |
|    9 | **St. Basil**                 | “Holy Basil, strengthen our minds and hearts.”               | Cancel one Consequence roll.                        |
|   10 | **St. Gregory**               | “Holy Gregory, voice of truth, guide our speech.”            | Auto success on one persuasion or diplomacy roll.   |
|   11 | **St. Ambrose**               | “Holy Ambrose, defender of the Church, stand with us.”       | Enemy Defense reduced by 2 for one scene.           |
|   12 | **St. Augustine**             | “Holy Augustine, turn our hearts toward God.”                | All PCs gain +1 Faith.                              |
|   13 | **St. Moses the Black**       | “Holy Moses, teach us repentance.”                           | One enemy is easier to convert, –2 to the Measure.  |
|   14 | **St. Benedict**              | “Holy Benedict, bring order to our labors.”                  | Fill 1 step on any task or building track.          |
|   15 | **St. Mary of Egypt**         | “Holy Mary, who found mercy, intercede for us.”              | All PCs gain +1 Charity.                            |
|   16 | **St. Athanasius**            | “Holy Athanasius, defend us from error.”                     | Cancel the enemy’s next action.                     |

|   18 | **St. Macrina**               | “Holy Macrina, inspire our hearts.”                          | All PCs gain +1 Hope.                               |
|   19 | **St. Ephrem**                | “Holy Ephrem, lift us with your song.”                       | All PCs gain +1 Charity.                            |
|   20 | **St. Michael the Archangel** | “Saint Michael, defend us in battle…”                        | A supernatural foe immediately loses 2 Steps.       |

✠ When invoking, the player should speak the prayer aloud, as a scribe would write or a pilgrim would chant. The Narrator then describes how the saint’s aid enters the story — in storm, in fight, or in silence of heart.  

---



*Sample Missions as Hagiographic Parables*  

✠ Just as monks wrote *exempla* — short stories to guide faith — these missions are written as examples of play. Each may be read aloud, adapted, or used whole. Marginal glosses (✍) provide the Narrator with alternate paths or reminders.  

---

## Exemplum I – Rebuilding the Village  

✠ *Background*: The raiders have gone, but ashes remain. The church lies ruined, manuscripts charred, the reliquary box lost. Villagers weep, quarrel, or fall silent in despair. The fellowship enters as strangers — yet pilgrims of Christ.  

### Phase I – Aftermath and Assessment  

- Choose a crisis: **Famine**, **Division**, or **Despair**.  
- Set requirements: 5 Wood, 2 Stone, 2 Food.  
- Relic Fragment Track (3 steps): Find → Restore → Sanctify.  

**Roleplay**:  

- Villager: *“Why build? The Northmen will burn it again.”*  
- Pilgrim: *“Hope is not in timbers but in Christ. Yet still we build.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: The Narrator may reveal that the relic box is buried under ash, or carried by a fleeing villager.  

---

### Phase II – Tasks and Foraging  

- Forage (1d6 Food), salvage wood and stone.  
- Rally workers with Hope or Charity.  
- Failures may spoil supplies or lengthen tracks.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“I bind timbers into beams with psalms upon my lips.”*  
- *“I search the ruins and salvage stones not cracked by fire.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A failed foraging roll may reveal a villager hoarding food, sparking a social challenge.  

---

### Phase III – The Community Challenge  

- Social Track: 4 Steps, Measure 14.  
- Choice: **Stay and Rebuild** vs. **Flee and Scatter**.  

**Roleplay**:  

- Agitator: *“Only a fool stays to die!”*  
- Knight: *“I swear before God, I will defend you.”*  
- Monastic: *“If we scatter, the Gospel itself will scatter.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A Conversion attempt may redeem an agitator — but a failure may embolden him.  

---

### Phase IV – Climax  

Choose one:  

- **Storm** (3 Steps, Measure 15) — threatens new chapel.  
- **Wolves** (2 Steps each, Measure 13).  
- **Raider Scout** — may be fought or converted.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“Brace the beams! Let the storm not undo us.”*  
- *“Stand firm; the wolves shall not scatter us.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: If Conversion succeeds on the raider, he may become a recurring ally in later missions.  

---

### Phase V – Resolution  

- If requirements met: chapel stands, relic sanctified, unity restored.  
- All roll Consequence and Reward.  

**Hooks Forward**:  

- Travelers come to seek blessings.  
- Raiders regroup.  
- A fugitive returns with tidings.  

✠ *Lesson*: Hope is rebuilt not only in stone, but in hearts.

## Exemplum II – The Lost Relic of the Morrígan  

✠ *Background*: A saint’s relic was taken to a bog shrine. Now whispers say the Morrígan, crow-demon of fate, haunts the mire. Crows gather, waters redden, fear deepens. The relic must be recovered and sanctified.  

### Phase I – Aftermath and Assessment  

- Place Relic Recovery Track (4 Steps, Measure 14).  
- Primary foe: *Morrígan’s Shade* — 5 Steps, Measure 16.  

**Roleplay**:  

- Elder: *“The idol drinks blood still. None dare go.”*  
- Navigator: *“The bog has many paths. I will find the true way.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: The Narrator may describe omens — crows at dusk, red water, whispers in the reeds.  

---

### Phase II – Journey and Foraging  

- Wayfinding required; failures add +1 journey step.  
- Foraging for herbs may stave off bog-sickness; major failure causes 1 Wound.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“I gather bitter herbs to ward us from fever.”*  
- *“The Bear will carry the weak through the mire.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A prophetic dream may reveal the idol’s location to the Illuminator.  

---

### Phase III – The Shrine  

- Four stages: Find → Lift → Cleanse → Sanctify.  
- Failures sink relic deeper or strengthen Shade.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“By rope and faith, I draw the chest from the mire.”*  
- *“Blessed be this relic; I wash it with psalms.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: If Sanctify fails, the Shade grows stronger in the Climax.  

---

### Phase IV – Climax: Morrígan’s Shade  

- *Fearful Cry* — failures cost 1 Hope to all.  
- *Wings of Shadow* — blocks one success until countered by Faith.  
- Cannot be slain by steel; only Faith, relics, or Intercession banish.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“By the saints, I rebuke thee!”*  
- *“See this art, a holy light against your darkness.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A player may sacrifice a relic fragment to weaken the Shade.  

---

### Phase V – Resolution  

- Relic recovered and sanctified: all gain +1 Faith; sanctifier gains +1 Charity.  
- Relic lost: all lose 1 Hope; Consequences are harsher.  

**Hooks Forward**:  

- Monastery library calls for defense.  
- Other pagan shrines stir.  
- A murder of crows follows the pilgrims.  

✠ *Lesson*: Relics are burdens of holiness, not trinkets. To recover them is to restore memory itself.  

---

## Exemplum III – The Divided Community  

✠ *Background*: No raiders here — but strife burns hotter than fire. Two families feud: one accused of cowardice, the other of betrayal. Anger spreads like plague. The fellowship must heal or watch the community break apart.  

### Phase I – Aftermath and Assessment  

- Central wound: **Betrayal**, **Greed**, or **Fear**.  
- Place Reconciliation Track (4 Steps, Measure 14).  

**Roleplay**:  

- Villager: *“They left us in our hour of need — why should we forgive?”*  
- Pilgrim: *“The Lord forgave His murderers. How much more should we forgive our brothers?”*  

✍ *Gloss*: If neglected, the feud erupts into bloodshed.  

---

### Phase II – Tasks and Mediation  

- Hospitality: share food, restore Hope.  
- Song & Story: recall unity, reduce Measure.  
- Sacred Reading: Illuminator lowers Measure by –2.  
- Acts of Service: Monastic heals or builds to earn goodwill.  

Failures harden hearts.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“Let me read the psalm of peace: how good it is when brothers dwell in unity.”*  
- *“We will mend your roof; you will mend theirs. Let labor bind what anger tore.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A family elder may soften if shown mercy in deed, not word.  

---

### Phase III – The Community Challenge  

- Council: Social Track, 4 Steps, Measure 15.  
- Conversion possible for hardened agitators.  

**Roleplay**:  

- Angry elder: *“Never shall I forgive!”*  
- Monastic: *“The saints bore exile without hatred. Let us bear it too.”*  

✍ *Gloss*: A partial success may bring truce but not reconciliation, setting a future mission.  

---

### Phase IV – Climax  

Choose one:  

- **Riot** — Brawl breaks out; failed rolls cost Wounds.  
- **Raid** — Raiders strike, exploiting division.  
- **Omen** — A banshee keens, or crows descend.  

**Roleplay**:  

- *“See, the enemy comes — will you fight each other still?”*  
- *“This omen is no fate, but a test. Choose unity.”*  

---

### Phase V – Resolution  

- If reconciled: All gain +1 Charity; feast grants +1 Hope.  
- If division endures: All lose 1 Hope; community weakens.  

**Hooks Forward**:  

- Another village calls for aid in reconciliation.  
- A reconciled family offers hidden relics.  
- If peace fails, spirits or raiders prey on division.  

✠ *Lesson*: To heal wounds of flesh is mercy; to heal wounds of heart is greater still.  

---

✠ *Thus the three exempla are written: rebuilding in hope, recovering in faith, and reconciling in charity. Each may be played as written or adapted, for missions are but parables awaiting new pilgrims to walk their path.*  

✠ *So end the Additional Matters, wherein are shown practices of faith, the witness of history, and the intercessions of the saints. May they guide the fellowship as much in play as in prayer, for the journey is one and the same.*  

## Quick Reference Tables  

✠ These tables serve the fellowship as a bookmark in the codex: a swift reminder of measures, flows, and holy rules. Let them be at hand during play, so the tale may move unhindered.

### The Measure and Scene Flow  

| Category              | Values                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **The Measure**       | 10 Easy • 12–14 Normal • 15–16 Hard • 17–18 Heroic           |
| **Scene Flow**        | Aftermath → Tasks or Social → Community Challenge → Climax → Resolution |
| **Conversion**        | Humans only. Roll d20 + Virtue vs Defense (the Measure). Success ends hostility; the acting PC gains +1 Charity or +1 Hope. If all convert and none are slain, all PCs gain +1 Faith. |
| **Supernatural Rule** | Cannot be defeated by mundane arms. Requires Faith, a relic, or Intercession for final victory. Often banished, not killed. |

---

✍ *Gloss*: The Narrator may always weave story even in quick play:  

- Aftermath reveals sorrow or loss.  
- Tasks and Social scenes show labor and persuasion.  
- The Challenge divides or unites the community.  
- The Climax tests body and soul.  
- Resolution closes the chapter with rest, consequence, and blessing.  

✠ *Thus even a table, simple to the eye, is a ladder for the soul of play.*  

# Colophon – The Scribe’s Seal and Benediction  

✠ Here ends *Peregrinatio*, the game of exile and pilgrimage, written for the telling of stories in Faith, Hope, and Charity.  

✠ If there be error, it is from man; if there be truth, it is from God.  

✠ Pray for those who labored to set down these words, and for those who raise them again in play, that each may walk their own road with patience and finish their pilgrimage in Christ.  

✠ May angels guard the reader, saints intercede for the player, and Christ Himself grant the crown to all who endure to the end.  

Kyrie eleison.  

Amen.  

---

✍ *Gloss*: In old codices, scribes often left prayers for those who would hold the book. Let players, too, take this blessing as their own, and remember: each game is a prayer written in fellowship.
